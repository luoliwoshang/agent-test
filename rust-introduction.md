# Rust Programming Language Documentation

## Overview

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segmentation faults, and guarantees thread safety. It accomplishes these goals through a sophisticated ownership system that manages memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Memory Safety
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Rust provides high-level features without runtime overhead
- **Ownership system**: Prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows
- **No garbage collector**: Manual memory management without the complexity

### Performance
- **Compiled language**: Rust compiles to native machine code
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: High-level features compile down to efficient low-level code
- **Minimal runtime**: No heavy runtime system overhead

### Concurrency
- **Fearless concurrency**: The ownership system prevents data races at compile time
- **Thread safety**: Built-in protection against concurrent access bugs
- **Async/await support**: Modern asynchronous programming patterns

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation

The easiest way to install Rust is through `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Your First Rust Program

Create a new file called `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

### Using Cargo (Rust's Package Manager)

Create a new project:

```bash
cargo new hello_world
cd hello_world
cargo run
```

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Ownership System

Rust's ownership system is based on three rules:

1. Each value has a single owner
2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
3. There can only be one owner at a time

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2, s1 is no longer valid
    
    println!("{}", s2); // This works
    // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile error
}
```

### Borrowing

Borrowing allows you to use a value without taking ownership:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // Borrow s1
    
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len); // s1 is still valid
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
} // s goes out of scope, but doesn't drop the String because it's borrowed
```

### Pattern Matching

Rust provides powerful pattern matching with `match`:

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

Rust uses `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");

    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", e),
            },
            other_error => {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", other_error)
            }
        },
    };
}
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

A typical Rust project structure:

```
my_project/
├── Cargo.toml          # Package configuration
├── Cargo.lock          # Dependency lock file
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs         # Main application entry point
│   ├── lib.rs          # Library root (if it's a library)
│   └── bin/            # Additional binary targets
├── tests/              # Integration tests
├── examples/           # Example code
└── benches/           # Benchmarks
```

## 📦 Package Management with Cargo

### Adding Dependencies

Add dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

### Common Cargo Commands

```bash
cargo new project_name    # Create a new project
cargo build              # Build the project
cargo run                # Build and run the project
cargo test               # Run tests
cargo doc                # Generate documentation
cargo publish            # Publish to crates.io
```
